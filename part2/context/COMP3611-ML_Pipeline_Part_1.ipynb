    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a recreation of Chapter 2 of the book *Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow*, first edition 2017, (There is a second edition), with adaptations to make the code run on the current *scikit-learn* interface. The dataset contains of house prices, geographical information, income of the home owner and some information about the house. The objective is to predict  the price of a new object, when information becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset features in a number of machine learning textbooks and therefore will probably be used as an example for years to come, even if some aspects look slightly dated. For example, a house price of 500k USD does not look especially opulent by today's standard but this is the cap in this dataset, as, apparently, it was judged that prices above that are too rare. The rate of inflation between 1994 and 2021 is 187%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of notebook contains a complete example of a machine learning pipeline. The objectives in this notebook (Part 1) are:\n",
    "- To download and unpack a realistic dataset\n",
    "- To split the data into test and training sets, with and without stratification\n",
    "- To explore the dataset and to disscover features that are potentially informative\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 2 we will\n",
    "- Impute and clean our dataset\n",
    "- Replace non-numeric information by numerical representations\n",
    "- Use transformers and pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 3 we will\n",
    "- Perform linear regression\n",
    "- Use decision trees and random forests for comparison\n",
    "- Perform cross validation and parameter search\n"
